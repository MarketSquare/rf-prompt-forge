# Context
The user wants to write a Robot Framework test case for a specific task. They are new to the framework. The goal is to guide them to create a well-structured, modern test case using best practices.

# Rules for the Final Test Case
{% block rules %}
{# Child templates will override this block with library-specific rules #}
1.  **BEST PRACTICES**: The generated test case **MUST** use a `*** Settings ***` section to import the required library and a `*** Test Cases ***` section.
2.  **CLEAR STRUCTURE**: Use clear, human-readable keyword names.
3.  **EXPLAIN THE CODE**: After providing the code block, explain each line of the test case clearly, connecting it back to the user's goal.
4.  **PROVIDE KEYWORD DOCUMENTATION**: For each library keyword used in the solution, you **MUST** provide its official documentation and arguments, which are included below.
