# Contributing to RF-Prompt-Forge

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project thrives on community involvement, and every contribution helps make Robot Framework more accessible for everyone.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Suggesting a New Prompt Template

Have a common Robot Framework task that you think would make a great template?
1.  **Open an Issue:** Go to the "Issues" tab and create a new issue.
2.  **Use the "Prompt Suggestion" template** (if available) or create a blank issue.
3.  **Describe the Task:** Clearly explain the workflow the prompt should solve (e.g., "A prompt to generate a keyword that logs into a website and handles errors").

### Submitting a New Prompt Template

If you've already created a prompt template that you'd like to add:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the project.
2.  **Create a New File:**
    -   Place your new template inside the appropriate category directory under `/prompts/`. If a category doesn't exist, feel free to suggest one.
    -   Name the file descriptively, e.g., `03-web-form-submission.md`.
    -   Use the same structure as existing templates (`# Persona`, `# Rules`, `# Task`, etc.).
3.  **Create a Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your fork to the main `MarketSquare/rf-prompt-forge` repository.
4.  **Describe Your PR:** Explain what your prompt does and why it's useful.

### Improving Existing Prompts

See a way to make an existing prompt better? Follow the same process as submitting a new prompt (Fork -> Modify File -> Pull Request).

Thank you again for your contribution!
